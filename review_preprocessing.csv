Mie Gacoan Semarang,Makiya Naura,5.0,"It's comfortable place to eat noodle. I ordered Mie Iblis lv.1. It's not spicy for me who dislike spicy. I can taste the sweet as well. Next I have to repeat order for this menu again. I really like the shrimp cheese for dimsum. For beverage, I ordered lemon tea. It's not bad but just so so. I think I've to try other beverages. Then surprisingly the price is cheap for me. Here will be my favorite place to eat or just hangout. When I came, it's pretty crowded but i didn't need wait in line for a long time. the cassier and the serving of the food are satisfying. Wait for my other coming. :)"

Mie Gacoan Semarang,Siti Mutmainah,4.0,"spacious parking, friendly service, good food, unfortunately the table is not cleaned immediately after the customer leaves so new customers have to clean it first"
Mie Gacoan Semarang,petricia pm,3.0,"Good place, I don't really like the service, the food's taste is average."
Mie Gacoan Semarang,siti iza,4.0,The noodle one of the Gacoan menu the taste was so delicious beside of the taste was so delicious the price was so cheap.Waitres serve was friendly.But I waited my food was length enough
Mie Gacoan Semarang,Stainley McFord,2.0,"1. The table is not spacious and not much, you still have to wait for an empty table for about half an hour before you can sit , and even then you have to fight with other customers 2. The food is oily 3. On the orange juice menu, what came was ""Nutrisari"" a kinda orange-flavored drink powder"
Mie Gacoan Semarang,__Y. Jun__ L.,2.0,"the taste of the food are not so good. I'm a fans of noodles sadly this one doesn't reach my expectations. but if you want to have a place to hangout with a group of friends this place can be one of the recommended list. spacious parking lot, good ambiance. if you have a good friends to hangout to then the taste of food doesn't really matter."
Mie Gacoan Semarang,Raden Bambang Suriadi,5.0,"This place very crowd! The place is very big but many people come to here to dine in. I suggested to take away. If you want to dine in, you must take a table first before put your order. The price is relatively cheap. For the taste, I can't give any review."
Mie Gacoan Semarang,Ananta Kanoko,5.0,"This business has a good potential to be very successful. The food option is not small. There's plenty of beverage option, and the uniques one such as Es Pocong or Es Genderuwo is quite refreshing. The price is definitely affordable. Unfortunately, there's no Mi Kuah or Noodle with soup/broth here, only fried (goreng) noodles. The appetizer is very appetizing, delicious, and worth the price. My favourite is Mi Angel with Udang Keju (Angel noodles with cheese-filled and breaded shrimp meatballs). The service is excellent, very friendly, and quite fast. Unfortunately, even before the opening time, people are already there, queuing. So chances are, the queue line is already long by the time you get there. That's how successful this noodle joint are right now. Oh, not to mention there's a parking fee. TL;DR Decent food, worth the price, excellent service. Recommended? Yes"
Mie Gacoan Semarang,Dewa Arjuna,3.0,Cashier didn't get my order correctly even though my writing is considerably good. Also next time drink comes before food.
Mie Gacoan Semarang,Joseph Ferdinand,5.0,Nice place and has lots of options menu. Recommended : mie setan and udang keju!!
Mie Gacoan Semarang,Eva Crystalia,4.0,Crowded but cozy with large parking lot. It's a half outdoor half indoor kind of restaurant. Noodle is the main dish. Low prices.
Mie Gacoan Semarang,HORCRUX RELIKUI,5.0,One of the best noodle restaurant Hope will get halal certified soon And the price still be the same Parking: 2000
Mie Gacoan Semarang,Fany C,4.0,"A fairly crowded place that serves noodle dishes and various dimsums. I ordered noodles, but the taste just tends to be spicy, too much oil, the taste is so-so. But for the dimsum it's quite good."
Mie Gacoan Semarang,Akma Ikasari,3.0,Ordered this via grab. The udang keju ke cheesy deep fried shrimp is definitely my favorite. The noodles are not that great and I think it's a little overhyped but it's not bad either. So yeah. Average.

Mie Gacoan Semarang,Dian Puji Pertiwi,5.0,"Good, recommended"
Mie Gacoan Semarang,abdurrohman nugroho,3.0,"Mie gacoan is a favorite place to eat for most people. People can enjoy delicious and cheap noodles. But it's a shame if you want to eat there you have to have extra patience, because the queues are long and sometimes the food comes first and the drinks come when our food is finished. It's better to bring drinks first than food so that visitors don't interfere with their meal"
Mie Gacoan Semarang,Bayu Aji,3.0,It's cheap. Place is big and parking is also spacious. I might have visited on one of their worst days because it was very crowded and so the service was awfully slow. The noodle dishes we ordered served cold. Well you can imagine cold oily noodle. We also ordered dimsum that I thought would at least be served warm. However it was also cold. Several things could be improved including how they deliver the food to customers using a numbered signage. I found the waiters walk around me looking confused several times for not finding the number they were looking for. They were definitely overwhelmed by the crowded visitors. The place is definitely aiming for those teenagers/students looking for a place to hang out. I don't think i'll be back unless somebody asks to meet there.

Mie Gacoan Semarang,Danu Djojosoemarto,4.0,"Surprisingly lively considering current situation (Ramadan & covid-19). Taste quite nice,there is a 50% off opening promo.

The price is affordable enough, even for students. Therefore, you will see long lines of visitors who order the food. It has large area to accommodate many visitors. Toilet and sink are provided for visitor's convenience. Visitors will also be pampered with an attractive interior space it has. All in all, it's definitely a good choice to be considered to visit when you're hungry."
Mie Gacoan Banyumanik,Jonathan Bayu,5.0,"A highly recommended place for its price and its overall experience.

Mie Gacoan Banyumanik,Daisy,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Try the breadfruit gacoan, the place is spacious and aesthetically pleasing for those who want to take photos. The toilet is also quite clean. The service is quite friendly and plentiful. Me gacoan here is open until 11 pm. So don't worry. What I ordered as usual, it's listed in the photo. For taste, the taste is the same as other me gacoan branches. And here the parking lot is spacious, yes.. and in my opinion it tends to be quieter than the others. Maybe because it's inside the gang... but it's good. So if you want to eat here when you're hungry, don't be afraid to faint before the food comes. Thank you üôèüèæ (Original) Nyobain me gacoan yg di sukun, tempatnya luas dan cukup estetik bagi yg ingin sekalian foto-foto. Toilet nya pun cukup bersih. Pelayanan nya cukup ramah dan banyak. Me gacoan disini buka hingga jam 11 malam. Jadi jangan khawatir ya. Yg aku pesen seperti biasanya,, tercantum di foto ya. Untuk rasa, taste nya sama seperti cabang me gacoan lainnya. Dan disini parkirannya luas ya.. dan menurutku disini cenderung lebih sepi di bandingkan yg lainnya. Maybe Krn di dalam gank.. tapi good sih . Jd kalau mau makan di sini saat laper, gak takut pingsan dulu baru makannya datang . Terima kasih üôèüèæ"
Mie Gacoan Banyumanik,faza,4.0,"(Translated by Google) I think this gacoan noodle branch is the quietest compared to other branches in Semarang (either because it just opened or because it's too close to the one near the horse statue). The queues are small and human, they don't spread long, at least there are only 3 or 4 queues. Spacious parking, so it doesn't make traffic jams, the place is also more comfortable and wider. The staff is fast, the food is fast, the prices are super cheap. There is also a prayer room, and the place is clean. Really, compared to those in faithfulness and dr. cipto, here is the most comfortable üòÇüòÇ (Original) Kayaknya ini cabang mie gacoan yang paling sepi dibanding cabang lainnya di Semarang (entah karena baru buka atau karena jaraknya terlalu dekat dengan yang di dekat patung kuda). Antriannya dikit dan manusiawi gak sampe menjalar panjang, paling cuma 3 atau 4 antrian saja. Parkiran luas, jadi gak bikin macet, tempatnya juga lebih nyaman dan lebih luas. Staffnya gercep, makanannya cepet, harga super murce. Ada musholla jugaa, dan bersih tempatnya. Beneran deh dibanding yang di setia budi dan dr. cipto, disini paling nyaman üòÇüòÇ Vegetarian options: Bisa aja asal gak nambah topping Parking: Parkiran luas dan lebih aksesibel"

Spacious parking, there are parking attendants too. The place is good for photos. Instagramable. But we don't take many photos. The menu served is like fried noodles with each one with a dumpling, don't forget to buy cheese prawns and dim sum. With pocket-friendly prices, the menu offered is quite worth it, especially the bonus of a comfortable place to eat. (Original) Smpai sini abis magrib bener, cuma antre 1 orang, pelayanan cepat. Karyawan banyak sekali dan cukup sigap dalam melayani tamu. Parkir luas, ada petugas parkir jg. Tempatnya bagus buat foto2. Instagramble. Tp kami ga foto2 banyak.

Besides that, the people who bought it also didn't understand at all, maybe you bought the menu as much as you wanted but just chose it right in front of the cashier?

Karena tanpa pelanggan pun omset perusahaan tidak mencukupi untuk menggaji mbak kasirüòä sehat selalu mbak semoga rejeki mbak kasirnya yang jaga di kasir ojek online pukul 17.30 an lancarüòâ"

Mie Gacoan,Vina Rosada,4.0,"(Translated by Google) The place is spacious, comfortable, there are indoor and outdoor. But still waiting in line for a seat. There is a play area for children. As for the noodles, I think it's good, but that's it. Not very tasty. Standard portion. For a really recommended price, it's perfect for the pockets of students or boarding children. Spacious parking lot. The toilet is clean, there is a sink too. Unfortunately, the table cleaners are not fast enough, so the plates and glasses of previous visitors are not immediately cleaned. (Original) Tempatnya luas, nyaman, ada indoor dan outdoor. Tapi masih tetep antri buat tempat duduk nya. Ada tempat bermain untuk anak anak. Untuk mie nya menurutku enak sih, tapi ya gitu aja. Bukan yang enak banget. Porsinya standar. Untuk harga rekomen banget, pas untuk kantong mahasiswa atau anak kost. Tempat parkir luas. Toilet bersih, ada wastafel juga. Sayangnya untuk petugas kebersihan meja kurang gercep, jadi piring dan gelas pengunjung sebelumnya gak langsung dibersihkan."
Mie Gacoan,Riska,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The gaconya is standard, it's delicious. It's just that the spiciness doesn't match the level, usually in other branches the lv 3 demons are already spicy. But this level 4 is spicy like level 1, a little disappointed I don't know if the cook is a bit sleepy or how to cook it... The drinks also took a long time to arrive. Even though it's just aesthetic, even though there are lots of employees. The employees also took a little longer to come to clean the finished table. Many are still confused, the seniors are also indifferent and not directed okay, skip The place is spacious, clean, & very comfortable. The parking spot is also spacious. So okay, can try again later (Original) Gacoannya ya standarlah yaa enaknya. Cuma pedesnya ga sesuai level, biasanya dicabang lain iblis lv 3 udah kerasa pedesnya. Tapi ini level 4 pedesnya kaya level 1, kecewa sedikit üòî Entah yg masak agak ngantuk atau gimana masaknya... Minumannya juga lama bgt datengnyaa. Padahal cuma esteh, padahal karyawan bejibun. Karyawan juga agak sedikit lama dateng buat bersihin meja yg udah selesai. Banyak yg masih bingung, seniornya jg cuek2 aja ga diarahin üòÖ oke skip Tempatnya sih luas, bersih, & nyaman banget.

Mie Gacoan,Fera widiastuti,1.0,"(Translated by Google) Most unpleasant experience. All the food has arrived, just don't drink enough. Wait for 1 hour to drink, ask the trening employee who will deliver the dimsum ""will ask later"". In fact, during training, the people didn't ask the kitchen at all. because I couldn't wait anymore, I finally went to the kitchen and asked myself with a receipt, ""How come my drink hasn't arrived even though the one who just sat down got a drink?"". Looking for a kitchen receipt, there isn't any, there's no one to accompany you. The only answer is yes, wait for it to be delivered. I waited 30 minutes and it didn't come. Going to the kitchen again, I immediately said the same as the one who made it, because I couldn't wait for the next one to bring it myself. But the waiter forced me to bring it. Very bad dine-in experience, no employee said sorry at all. Usually it's not like this, there are indeed many employees who are trending but come on, don't be so bad. Even the table next to the dimsum didn't come."" Even though their food was finished, it was so annoying to be left behind. Please improve it again (Original) Pengalaman paling tidak menyenagkan. Semua makananan udah dateng, kurang minum aja. Nunggu 1 jam buat minum, tanyak ke pegawai trening yang antar dimsum ""nanti ditanyain"". Kenyataanya waktu dilat orang nya gak tanyak ke dapunya sama sekali. karena udah gak bisa nunggu lagi akhirnya ke bagian dapur tanyak sendiri dengna bawa struk, "" Kok minuman saya belum dateng padahal yang baru duduk dah dapet minum? "". Dicariin struk dapur gak ada dong, gak ada yg nganter jga.Cuman dijawab iya tunggu dulu nanti dianterin. Udah ditunggu 30 menit gak dateng juga. Ke dapur lagi langsung bilang sama yang bikin, karena udah gak sabar aku tungguin depan yg buat tak bawa sendiri aja. Tp pelayanya maksa saya bawain aja. Buruk banget pengalaman dine in, pegawai gak ada yg bilang maaf sama sekali. Biasanya gak gini, emang banyak pegawai yang trening tapi yo mbok jangan parah banget. Bahkan meja sebelah dimsumnya gak dateng"" Padahal makanan mereka udah abis, saking sebelnya ditinggal balik. Tolong lah ditingkatin lagi"
Mie Gacoan,Amirudi Brebes,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Honestly, I just like dumplings, noodles, cheese prawns, it's not like my taste, but if you dip it into the sauce, it's sweet, sour, fresh, I like it, but the sauce is a little bit for me, hehe, for portions, packaging, the place is clean and spacious, at that price it's cheap, but btw why can't you dine in now? (Original) Jujur, aku cuma suka pangsit nya aja, mie, udang keju, kayak bukan selera aku gitu, tapi kalo dicocol saos nya manis, asam, seger, suka, tapi saosnya dikit buat aku, hehe, untuk porsi, kemasan, tempat bersih luas, dengan harga segitu sih murah, tapi btw kenapa sekarang gak boleh Dine in ya?"
Mie Gacoan,liana afiyani,3.0,"(Translated by Google) Sorry, I'm really new to gacoan in ngaliyan. This is the first time I've had bad service from Gacoan. In other branches it's safe. Only this digaliyan service is not pleasant. In other branches, usually 2 people want to sit anywhere freely. This is where the seats are arranged. And the way it is delivered is unpleasant and seems to be cornering. The menu came, the dimsum place was really dirty. Was it not washed or what? How come there are so many chilies? And even worse, it seems like driving away customers. The meal has not been finished, it has been offered to take the food and the cleaning service. No more buying at the ngaliyan branch. (Original) Maaf baru banget nyoba gacoan di ngaliyan. Baru pertama kali dapat pelayanan yg buruk dari gacoan. Dicabang lain aman-aman aja. Cuma dingaliyan ini pelayanannya kurang menyenangkan. Di cabang lain biasanya buat 2 orang mau duduk dimana aja bebas. Disini tempat duduk diatur. Dan cara penyampaiannya tidak menyenangkan dan terkesan memojokkan. Menu datang, tempat dimsum kotor banget. Apa gak dicuci atau gimana ya. Kok bisa sampe ada cabe2 banyak. Dan lebih parahnya terkesan seperti mengusir pelanggan. Makan belum selesai, sudah ditawari mau diambil aja makanannya sama cleaning service. Gak lagi deh beli dicabang ngaliyan."

Mie Gacoan,okky davriell,2.0,"(Translated by Google) just ordinary, cheap prices, lack of cleanliness, my dumpling puring is very oily, even though I saw when I was waiting in line at the cashier the dumplings were ready, not the ones that had to wait for it to be fried, so the logic is that if the plate is clean, it shouldn't be that greasy, the straw is really good wrapped in paper, but the tray that was used was wet, so the straw was dirty, wet and muddy, and I was sitting in the outdoor area, asked to move to the indoor (he said he wanted to close the outdoor area) eh, until I finished eating, didn't close the outdoor too even the outdoor one is getting fuller. The cashier queue for ojol takes precedence. Those who dine in queue are very long, there must be a special cashier for ojol or online orders, or join the queue with dine-in. And I also have extras for takeaway packing which is messy It's really annoying to pile up. In the end, I took the initiative to ask for more crackers to be divided into 2 crackers, because there are 6 portions and only put it in 1 crackle. (Original) biasa aja,harga murah,kebersihan ny kurang,puring pangsit sy berminyak bgt,pdhal sy lihat pada waktu antri kasir pangsit udah jadi,bukan yang harus nunggu di goreng,jd logika ny piring klo bersih ya hrs ny nggak seberminyak itu,sedotan nya ng terbungkus kertas,namum nampan yang di gunakan basah jd sedotan nya kotor basah becek gtu,dan sy duduk di area outdoor,di minta pindah ke indoor (katanya sih mau di tutup area outdoor ny) eh sampai sy selesai makan kaga di tutup jg outdoor ny malah yang ada outdoor ny tambah keisi.antrian kasir jg ojol di dahulukan kita yg dine in antrian sampai panjang banget,hrs ny ada kasir khusus ojol atau pesanan online,atau ikut antri dengan dine in.dan sy jg ada tambahan buat takeaway packing ny berantakan bgt ngasal numpuk nya.akhir ny sy inisiatif buat minta kresek lagi ubtuk di bagi 2 kresek,krn ada 6 porsi dan hanya di masukan dalam 1 kresek."

Mie Gacoan,Naayaa 08,1.0,"(Translated by Google) The waiter is not friendly, the cashier is curt and the food delivery man if you want to ask the customer to move places according to the number of good people, don't feel like driving away. This is the last time eating here, don't tell your family and relatives you don't have to eat here, give up the service. Don't feel like every day is busy so you underestimate the customer. Indeed, people have the upper hand so they forget the land. If you fall, just remember. Just name the menu devil's noodle and devil's noodle, don't do that kind of service either. Hopefully better.. (Original) Pelayannya kurang ramah, kasirnya ketus dan pengantar makannnya kalau mau nyuruh customer pindah tempat sesuai jumlah orangnya yang baik jangan kesannya seperti mengusir. Ini cukup terakhir makan di sini, tak bilangi keluarga dan saudara ndak usah makan di sini, kapok pelayannnya. Jangan merasa setiap hari rame jadi menyepelekan customer.

Mie Gacoan,ahsani taqwim,5.0,"(Translated by Google) The taste remains the same in every branch.

Mie Gacoan,Immrssa,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Finally, try to eat noodles which are hits again, I really miss it, yeeüòÇ. Yes, how does it end if every time it passes, it's always busy, so lazy to queue like a train . Finally, try it here when it's pretty quiet . In my opinion, the service when I came here was OK, it was quite good, the parking was limited for four-wheeled users. In terms of food, especially the noodles, I think it's delicious. But, that's not a good thing, hlo. Hehe, I'm a spicy, salty and savory lover, so order Mie Devil if I'm not mistaken the name . Then I ordered a noodle companion snack, such as style dim sum, crispy prawn balls. It's delicious, but the sauce is still not enough. Okay, and I just drink iced tea hehe. Oh yeah, about the cleanliness of the place to eat, I'm sorry it's still not clean, maybe because the place is crowded, so cleaning plates etc is not max. Huhu... The rest is pretty good, oh yes, there is also a prayer room inside. (Original) Akhirnya nyobain makan mie yang lagi hits wkwk ketinggalan banget yeeüòÇ. Ya gimana habis nya kalo setiap lewat nih selalu ruame yah, jadi males ngantri kayak keretaüòÖ. Finally, nyobain kesini pas lumayan sepi üòã. Pelayanannya menurut saya waktu kesini sih OK cukup bagus, parkirannya yang mefet kalo buat pengguna roda empat. Dari segi makanan terutama Mie nya menurut saya Enak. But, bukan yang enak buanget gitu hlo. Hehe saya pecinta pedas, asin gurih jadi pesen Mie Iblis kalo tidak salah namanyaüôà. Terus saya pesen cemilan pendamping Mie, seperti dimsum ala ala, bola bola udang crispy, Enak sih, cuman cocolan saus nya masih kurang Oke, dan minumnya saya Es Teh aja hehe. Oiya untuk soal kebersihan tempat makannya nih mohon maaf masih kurang bersih ya, mungkin karena tempatnya ramai, jadi bersihin piring dsb kurang max. Huhu... Selebihnya Cukup bagus, oiya disediakan tempat sholat juga kok di dalam."

Keluhan saya semoga bisa menjadi koreksi untuk mie gacoan"
Mie Gacoan,Gilson Gil,1.0,(Translated by Google) This restaurant hopes that we can predict which menu is spicy and which is not spicy because it seems too busy for a second to put a mark on the packaging. Or maybe they expect us to try everyone's food one by one until we know which one suits our level of spiciness. (Original) Restoran ini berharap kita bisa meramalkan mana menu yg pedas dan mana yg tidak pedas karena rupanya terlalu repot untuk sedetik memberikan tanda pada kemasannya. Atau mungkin mereka berharap kita mencoba satu persatu makanan semua orang hingga kita tau mana yg sesuai dengan level kepedasan kita.
